# Sending form data

the very basic idea about sending data is a client sends a request to a server. using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol.

## The GET method

The GET method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource: "Hey server, I want to get this resource." In this case, the browser sends an empty body. Because the body is empty, if a form is sent using this method the data sent to the server is appended to the URL.

```
<form action="http://www.foo.com" method="GET">
  <div>
    <label for="say">What greeting do you want to say?</label>
    <input name="say" id="say" value="Hi">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="to">Who do you want to say it to?</label>
    <input name="to" id="to" value="Mom">
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Send my greetings</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

## The POST method

It's the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request: "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result." If a form is sent using this method, the data is appended to the body of the HTTP request.

```
<form action="https://www.foo.com" method="POST">
  <div>
    <label for="say">What greeting do you want to say?</label>
    <input name="say" id="say" value="Hi">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="to">Who do you want to say it to?</label>
    <input name="to" id="to" value="Mom">
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Send my greetings</button>
  </div>
</form>
```
